							<h3>
								German Short Hair Pointers are high energy and a medium sized dog
							</h3>
							<p>
								Male German Shorthaired Pointers stand between 23 and 25 inches at the shoulder and can weigh anywhere from 55 to 70 pounds; females are smaller in height and weight. The coat is solid liver (a reddish brown), or liver and white in distinctive patterns. Built to work long, hard days in the field or at the lake, GSPs are known for power, speed, agility, and endurance. The overall look is often described as "noble" and "aristocratic."<a href="http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/german-shorthaired-pointer/detail/">Quoted from the AKC</a>
